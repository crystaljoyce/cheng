    <div className='our-text'> We believe that fashion should be fun. Every person has a personal style 
    somewhere within them and it just takes a little creativity, instruction, and organization to pull it out! 
    If you are frustrated by the fit of your clothing, don’t know how to put clothing items together, or find 
    yourself constantly uttering the words “I have nothing to wear” - a personal stylist and wardrobe consultant 
    is for you. We not only alleviate the stress of shopping, we teach you how to put together capsule collections 
    and make the most out of the wardrobe you already have. </div></div>

    <div className='our-text'> We start with virtual consultation to understand your goals, get a sense of who 
    you are and see if we’re the best fit for your wardrobe needs. If a connection is made, we can get right 
    into it with a closet curation appointment, personal shopping session or wardrobe consultation.  </div></div>

    <h2 className='our-title'>Getting Styled</h2>
    <div className='our-text'> We offer a variety of styling services to elevate your image and enhance your 
    confidence. Our menu-style offerings allow you to mix and match based on your current needs. Feel like you 
    need the ultimate refresh? We can build a high-touch plan that starts with a closet curation and ends with 
    style boards, personal shopping and an image overhaul! If you’re not ready to make the full plunge into 
    something so robust, start with quarterly virtual style boards and come back when you need more. </div></div>
